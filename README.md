# 50MiniProjects
Here I have 50 mini web development projects:
1) Expanding Cards: expands the card or picture you click on
2) Progress Steps: highlights the progress
3) Rotating Navigation: rotates the navigation bar
4) Hidden Search Widget: when you click on the search icon it expands and shows the search bar
5) Blurry Loading: the background is blurry when its loading 
6) Scroll Animation: Content shows up as you scrol down
7) Split Landing Page: Splits the page in half, when you hover over an image or side that side becomes the main cover
