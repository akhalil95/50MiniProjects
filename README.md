# 50MiniProjects
Here I have 50 mini web development projects:
1) Expanding Cards: expands the card or picture you click on
2) Progress Steps: highlights the progress
3) Rotating Navigation: rotates the navigation bar
4) Hidden Search Widget: when you click on the search icon it expands and shows the search bar
